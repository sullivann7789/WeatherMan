### It's as if your dreams of a simplified weather app, with a style almost as dashing as Ron Burgundy from Anchorman himself, revealed itself to you in an epiphany of divinity...

### How could this be?

### What may I call it?

## You maybe asking yourself this... well, my friend, his name...

# IS ...

## Save and Delete Capabilities
Users also have the option to save and delete weather details by city. Once a city, or cities, are saved, a user can return to the WeatherMan at any point in time and conveniently look at their forecast with the click of a button (Saved Locations button to be exact).

If a user decides that he/she would like to delete the city and it's corresponding data, all they will have to do is click the Clear button on the right hand side of their city.

If their city is Saved, than they will have to delete their city with the Delete Saved Cities button at the bottom, which effectively clears all storage and deletes any weather information displayed on the screen.

Simple enough right? 

Well feel free to give it a spin here:
